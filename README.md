# RouteSync

**RouteSync** is a route optimization system developed to improve delivery efficiency for PepsiCo by leveraging AI and historical data. The system minimizes fuel costs, reduces delivery delays, and ensures optimized delivery routes for multiple trucks. It integrates an LSTM model for predicting delivery sequences and a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for refining routes.

## **Features**

1. **Route Optimization**:
   - Combines LSTM and Genetic Algorithm to generate and optimize delivery routes.
   - Minimizes fuel consumption and total travel distance.

2. **User Authentication**:
   - Secure user login and registration with password hashing using Bcrypt.
   - Role-based access control for users (e.g., Logistic Manager, Administrator).

3. **Interactive Dashboard**:
   - Visualize delivery progress, completion rates, and optimized routes.
   - Provides detailed analytics for delivery statuses.

4. **Password Recovery**:
   - Secure password reset via email with token-based authentication.

5. **Scalable Backend**:
   - Built using Flask for API management and MongoDB for dynamic data storage.

6. **Historical Data Analysis**:
   - Learns from past delivery data to improve future predictions.

## **Tech Stack**

### **Backend**
- Flask: Lightweight framework for API and backend development.
- TensorFlow: For training and running the LSTM model.
- Bcrypt: Password hashing for secure authentication.
- MongoDB: NoSQL database for scalable and flexible data storage.

### **Frontend**
- React.js: Interactive UI for managing and visualizing delivery data.

### **Other Tools**
- Genetic Algorithm: Optimizes delivery routes generated by the LSTM model.
- Python: Primary language for backend and AI model development.
- PyMongo: Flask extension for MongoDB integration.

## **System Architecture**

1. **Frontend**:
   - Users interact with the React.js UI to upload data, view routes, and track delivery performance.

2. **Backend**:
   - Flask API handles:
     - File uploads.
     - Route generation and optimization.
     - User authentication and role management.
     - Interaction with MongoDB.

3. **AI Models**:
   - **LSTM** predicts the sequence of delivery points based on historical data.
   - **GA** refines these predictions to minimize distance and fuel consumption.

4. **Database**:
   - MongoDB stores:
     - User details (hashed passwords).
     - Historical delivery records.
     - Reset tokens for password recovery.

## **Installation**

### **Prerequisites**
1. Python 3.8+
2. MongoDB installed and running locally or remotely.
3. Node.js (for frontend setup).

### **Backend Setup**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/azafar224/routeSync.git
   cd routeSync
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Start the Flask server:
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

### **Frontend Setup**
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the React development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## **Usage**

### **1. User Authentication**
- **Register**: Create a new account with name, email, and password.
- **Login**: Access the system by logging in with valid credentials.
- **Forgot Password**: Reset password using an emailed reset link.

### **2. Route Optimization**
- Upload a CSV file with delivery data via the dashboard.
- View optimized routes and download them in CSV format.
- Analyze delivery performance using the interactive dashboard.

### **3. Admin Controls**
- Manage user roles and access levels.
- Monitor overall delivery progress.

## **Security Measures**

1. **Password Security**:
   - Uses Bcrypt for hashing passwords before storing them in the database.
   - Prevents storing plain-text passwords.

2. **Session Management**:
   - Tracks logged-in users securely with Flask sessions.

3. **Token-Based Password Reset**:
   - Ensures secure and time-limited password recovery links.

4. **Role-Based Access Control**:
   - Restricts access to certain features based on user roles.

---

## **Future Enhancements**

1. **Real-Time Traffic Integration**:
   - Incorporate live traffic data for dynamic rerouting.

2. **Live GPS Tracking**:
   - Track delivery vehicles in real-time.

3. **Scalable Cloud Deployment**:
   - Host the application on platforms like AWS or Google Cloud.

4. **Advanced Analytics**:
   - Include predictive insights and delivery forecasts.
